This package doesn't work at all yet
====================================

I just created this repo because is my intention to port Anaconda extension or Sublime Text 3 to GitHub Atom. I never used CoffeeScript or Node.JS. This process is not going to be fast btw.

Anaconda
========

Anaconda is a python development suite that includes autocompletion, IDE features, linting with PyLint or PyFlakes + pep8, AutoPEP8 , Vagrant and more for Github Atom.

A bit of history
----------------

Anaconda was born as an extension for Sublime Text 3 with the aim to provide a full Python development environment in a single package for Python developers. Anaconda was adopted by the Python community really fast and is actually widely used.

Anaconda architecture
---------------------

Anaconda is an `asynchronous client-server` architecture application.

Supported platforms
-------------------

Anaconda has been tested in OS X with excelent results. The status of the plugin in the different platforms is:

* **OS X**: Unstable
